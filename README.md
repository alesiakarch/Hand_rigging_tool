# Hand_rigging_tool

This set of pythong scripts is used to create a hand rig, using some functionality of my rigging library,
developed for this project

To use the scripts:

1. Drop riglib.py into your maya/scripts folder, usually User/Documents/maya/(version)/scripts
2. Paste hand_script.py into your script editor and execute

The Source_code folder also includes the hand_demo.ma to test the script in. 
That file contains the hand joint chain and IK_cntrls. 
The script does nothing for the skinning part of the process, but there is also hand geo available to test the rig visually. However you will need to attach skin manually.
